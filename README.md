https://bitsrc.io/ - Bit 
Frontend (components) Bit helps you organize your components, share them as a team and keep them synced in all your projects.
This environment enables you to use and develop components from other projects. For example, components written in typescript can be used and developed in a project written in flow-typed. It also lets Bit test and build your components in isolation, so you can know the exact state of every component.
